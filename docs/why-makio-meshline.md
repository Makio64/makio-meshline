# **Makio MeshLine**

Makio MeshLine is a **TSL‑powered line library for Three.js** that delivers fast, easy to customizable thick lines with modern features made by [Makio64](https://x.com/makio64).

It's built for WebGPURenderer and both Backends (WebGPU & WebGL) 

## Why a new MeshLine?

Back in 2015s, TheSpite released [TheSpite's MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine), it opened up new possibilities for thick, styled lines in Three.js, allowing the creation of new effects & explore new horizons.

With Three.js evolving, there was a need for a modern Meshline version that leverages TSL power and improved the core concept.

`Makio MeshLine` is my vision of it : built to be performant, simple but flexible. It allows creators to focus on ideas rather than implementation details.

## Improvements 

- Modernize the stack: first‑class TSL nodes and WebGPU pipeline
- Push performance: minimal uploads, smart attributes, large indices
- Instancing out of the box
- Expand flexibility: rich node hooks (position, width, color, opacity, dash), CPU or GPU positions, miter options, gradients, textures, dashes
- Simplify usage: a chainable, ergonomic Fluent API
- Handy helpers (`circlePositions`, `straightLine`, etc.)
- Sustain long‑term: ESM‑only, typed, tree‑shakeable
