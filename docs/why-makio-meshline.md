# **Makio MeshLine**

Back in 2015s, TheSpite released [TheSpite's MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine), it opened up new possibilities for thick, styled lines in Three.js, allowing the creation of new effects & explore new horizons. 

With Three.js evolving, there was a need for a modern Meshline version that leverages TSL power and improved the core concept.

`Makio MeshLine` is my vision of it : built to be performant, simple but flexible. It allows creators to focus on ideas rather than implementation details.

Best,

## MeshLines

A `Meshline` is a mesh with special geometry / material representing one or more lines, it helps to create a variety of renders, feelings & experiences.
