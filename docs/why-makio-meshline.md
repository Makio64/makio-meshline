# Why Makio MeshLine

In the world of creative coding, lines are more than just linesâ€”they're expressive tools for visualization, animation, and art. I think it's fascinating how `meshlines` can create such a variety of renders, feelings & experiences.

Back in 2015s, I particularly enjoyed using [TheSpite's MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine), which opened up new possibilities for thick, styled lines in Three.js, allowing us (creative devs) to create new effects & explore new horizons. 

This interest in advanced line rendering was shared by talented creative coders who've pushed boundaries with custom shaders and effects.

However, with Three.js evolving, I feel there was a need for a modern MeshLine that leverages TSL (Three Shader Language) for more efficient & customizable shaders. 

`Makio MeshLine` is my vision of it: built to be performant, flexible, and easy to extend, allowing creators to focus on ideas rather than implementation details.

A big thanks to the community, especially to my friend [@Floz](https://x.com/florianzumbrunn) for his constant support, [Samsyyyy](https://x.com/Samsyyyy) for the early tests & feedbacks, to [TheSpite](thespite) for making the first version i knew of MeshLine, to [MrDoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) and [Sunag](https://github.com/sunag) for Three.js and TSL!

Best, [Makio64](https://x.com/makio64)
