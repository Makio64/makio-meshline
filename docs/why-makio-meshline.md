# Why Makio MeshLine

In the world of creative coding, lines are more than just linesâ€”they're expressive tools for visualization, animation, and art. I've always been fascinated by how simple polylines can variety of renders, feelings & experiences.

I particularly enjoyed using [TheSpite's MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine), which opened up new possibilities for thick, styled lines in Three.js. The interest in advanced line rendering is also shared by talented creative coders like [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl), [Nathan Gordon](https://github.com/nrstudios), and many others who've pushed boundaries with custom shaders and effects.

However, with Three.js evolving, there was a need for a modern MeshLine that leverages TSL (Three Shader Language) for efficient, customizable shaders. Makio MeshLine is built to be performant, flexible, and easy to extend, allowing creators to focus on ideas rather than implementation details.

A big thanks to the community, especially to [MrDoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) and [Sunag](https://github.com/sunag) for Three.js and TSL and to my friends @Samsy & @FlorianZumbrun for their reviews & feedbacks .
