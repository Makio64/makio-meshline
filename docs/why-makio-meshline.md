# Why Makio MeshLine

In the world of creative coding, lines are more than just linesâ€”they're expressive tools for visualization, animation, and art. I think it's fascinating how polylines / `meshlines` can create such a variety of renders, feelings & experiences.

Back in the 2016s, I particularly enjoyed playing with [TheSpite's MeshLine](https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine), which opened up new possibilities for thick, styled lines in Three.js, allowing us (creative devs) to create new effects & explore new horizons. I forked & customized this source code so many times! 

This interest in advanced line rendering was also shared by talented creative coders like [Matt DesLauriers](https://github.com/mattdesl) and his famous article [`drawing-lines-is-hard`](https://mattdesl.svbtle.com/drawing-lines-is-hard), [Nathan Gordon](https://github.com/nrstudios) with [`crafting-stylised-mouse-trails-with-ogl`](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2019/09/24/crafting-stylised-mouse-trails-with-ogl/) , [Florian Zumbrunn](https://github.com/nrstudios) who make so many cool examples,[Matt Groves](https://github.com/nrstudios) and his MeshRopes in `pixi.js`, and many others who've pushed boundaries with custom shaders and effects.

However, with Three.js evolving, there was a need for a modern MeshLine version that leverages TSL (Three Shader Language) for efficient, customizable shaders. Makio MeshLine is built to be performant, flexible, and easy to extend, allowing creators to focus on ideas rather than implementation details.

A big thanks to the community, to my friends @Samsy & @Floz for their feedbacks, to [TheSpite](thespite) for making the father version to [MrDoob](https://github.com/mrdoob) and [Sunag](https://github.com/sunag) for Three.js and TSL.

Best, [Makio64](https://x.com/makio64)
