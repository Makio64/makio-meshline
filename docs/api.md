# API Reference

Makio MeshLine is build with creative coding requierement in mind : **performance**, **customization**, **simplicity** so you can focus on your creativity. 

It's build for the futur, using `TSL` and is compatible only with the new `WebGPURenderer` (But both backend: `WebGPU`/`WebGL2`)

## [MeshLine](/meshline)

High-level façade – **the class you will use 99 % of the time**. 

```ts
new MeshLine(options?: MeshLineOptions)
```

For better convenience use the fluent API bellow

```ts
new Meshline().color(0xff0000).gradient(0xff00ff) //etc..
```

## [MeshLineGeometry](/meshline-geometry)

Low-level geometry builder – it's created internally by the `Meshline`, reach for it when you need to **update or add extra buffer attributes**.

```ts
new MeshLineGeometry(options?: MeshLineGeometryOptions)
```

## [MeshLineNodeMaterial](/meshline-material)

Specialised `NodeMaterial` that understands the vertex attributes generated by `MeshLineGeometry` and renders them with:

* Screen-space or size-attenuated thickness
* Optional gradients, textures, dashes, etc..
* Optional miter-clipping for super-sharp corners
* Optional TSL hooks to customize the vertex & fragment easily

```ts
new MeshLineNodeMaterial(parameters?: MeshLineNodeMaterialParameters)
```

## Implementation Notes

* Only the uniforms / attributes needed are created & uploaded to the GPU.
* There is many hooks available for customizing the basic behavior / rendering of the lines
* Instancing + gpu position will allow you to render thousands of lines like a breeze
* You can also use batching for performant cpu controled animation or static lines 
* No runtime dependencies beyond `three`
