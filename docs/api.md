# API Reference

Makio MeshLine is build with creative coding requierement in mind : **performance**, **customization**, **simplicity** so you can focus on your creativity. 

It's build for the futur, using `TSL` and is compatible only with the new `WebGPURenderer` (both backend: `WebGPU`/`WebGL2`)

### Architecture

`MeshLine` (extends Mesh) – Entry point, Most of the time you will only instantiate it 

`MeshLineGeometry` (extends BufferGeometry) – builds vertex buffers 

`MeshLineNodeMaterial` (extends TSL NodeMaterial) – GPU rendering 



#### Implementation Notes

* Only the uniforms / attributes needs are created & uploaded to the GPU.
* There is many hooks available for customizing the basic behavior / rendering of the lines
* Instancing + gpu position will allow you to render thousands of lines like a breeze
* You can use batching for cpu control animation or static lines
* No runtime dependencies beyond `three`

## Classes
## [MeshLine](/meshline)

High-level façade – **the class you will use 99 % of the time**.

```ts
new MeshLine(options?: MeshLineOptions)
```

## [MeshLineGeometry](/meshline-geometry)

Low-level geometry builder – reach for it when you need to **mutate vertices each frame** or share a single geometry across many materials.

```ts
new MeshLineGeometry(options?: MeshLineGeometryOptions)
```

## [MeshLineNodeMaterial](/meshline-material)

Specialised `NodeMaterial` that understands the vertex attributes generated by `MeshLineGeometry` and renders them with:

* Screen-space or size-attenuated thickness
* Optional gradients, textures, dashes, etc..
* Optional miter-clipping for super-sharp corners
* Optional TSL hooks to customize the vertex & fragment easily

```ts
new MeshLineNodeMaterial(parameters?: MeshLineNodeMaterialParameters)
```
